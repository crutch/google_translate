google translate API
This is based on the documentation found here
http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/#Versioning
look for the paragraph 'Flash and other Non-Javascript Environments'

HOWTO
======
include module GoogleTranslate (or use it as namespace, as required)
translate:
translator = Translator.new("en","fr") # so several translations can be performed with this new object
result = translator.translate("nice day today") # returns "belle journ√©e aujourd'hui"

language detection:
detector = LanguageDetect.new
language = detector.detect("il fait beau aujourd'hui") # returns "fr"


TODO
======
* It's not mandatory, but they ask for an API key to be included.  This could be added later on if required, preferrably in a YAML style config file.
* handle untranslateable strings

Look at specs for behaviour.

Suggestions are welcome !
